        <h2>An Essay About Cow</h2>
        <p>Cow, in common parlance, a <span class="imp">domestic bovine</span>, regardless of sex and age, usually of the species 
        Bos taurus. In precise usage, the name is given to mature females of several large mammals, 
        including cattle (bovines), moose, elephants, sea lions, and whales.
        Domestic cows are one of the most common farm animals around the world, and the English language 
        has several words to describe these animals at various ages. A baby cow is called a calf. A female 
        calf is sometimes called a heifer calf and a male a bull calf. A heifer is a female that has not 
        had any offspring. The term usually refers to immature females; after giving birth to her first 
        calf, however, a heifer becomes a cow. An adult male is known as a bull. Many male cattle are 
        castrated to reduce their aggressive tendencies and make them more tractable. Young neutered 
        males, which are primarily raised for beef, are called steers or bullocks, whereas adult neutered 
         males, which are usually used for draft purposes, are known as oxen.</p>
